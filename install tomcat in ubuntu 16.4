Installing Tomcat 7
Step 1: Create the Tomcat Folder

Logged in as root, within the opt folder make a directory called tomcat 
and cd into that folder after completion.

Step 2: Install Tomcat Through Wget

Click this link to the Apache Tomcat 7 Download site.
 Place your cursor under 7.0.90 Binary Distributions, 
right click on the tar.gz file and select Copy Link Address (as shown in the picture below).  
At the time of this article Tomcat 7 is the newest version but feel free to pick 
whatever version is more up-to-date.

버전확인:Tomcat Version 7.0.90

Next, from your server, use wget command to download the tar 
to  the tomcat folder from the URL you copied in the previous step:

압축풀기:tar xvzf apache-tomcat-7.0.90.tar.gz

You will end up with a file called apache-tomcat-7.0.90.

apt-get install default-jdk
rm
 

Step 4: Configure .bashrc file

Set the environment variables in .bashrc with the following command:

빔설치: vim ~/.bashrc

Add this information to the end of the file:
